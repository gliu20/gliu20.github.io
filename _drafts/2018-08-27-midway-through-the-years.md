# A Note on Versioning
While it might seem as though I am using Semantic Versioning (or SemVer as the developer community calls it), I actually simply increase the numbers based on how significant I feel the change to be, rather than simply increasing a major number or minor number based on the corresponding magnitude of change. 

# The Initial Prototype (v1.3.15) 
Yes, the initial prototype does not start from 0.0.0 or even 1.0.0, it starts at 1.3.15. Although it may seem unintuitive, it is actually because I've re-written my code several times and I didn't feel like labeling it such a mundane 1.0.0. It's a bit whack, but that's ok.

But I digress.

At this point, Midway was a simple extension, merely displaying the end of the period in a little box in the corner, called the timebox. Although you could move the timebox out of the way, the position did not persist across tabs. This meant that every time you refreshed the page or when you opened a new tab, Midway's timebox was back in the top left corner. Furthermore, Midway, due to a bug, sometimes interfered with other pages and prevented their loading. In addition, the timebox lacked a close button, which proved annoying for some users, when Midway covered an important item on the page.

# No longer just a prototype (v1.4.2)
