    Can't find the timebox.
  </summary>
  Click on the extension icon in the browser toolbar. Check to make sure there is a schedule and a current period. If there is not, Midway will not display time information as it is unavailable.
  
  If period information is available, press the re-center timebox button to make sure the timebox is in a visible part of the screen. If that does not work, try toggling the timebox.
  If you experience any further problems, please contact us.
