Midway (the “Developer”) is committed to maintaining robust privacy protections for its users. Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service.  

For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the extension, which can be downloaded from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/midway/cgibedogghadelndgfacffoociffapii).
Through these services, users can, where available, know the current period’s end time, find out about absent teachers, access the school’s bulletin board, and more.
The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the “Developer”.
“You” refers to you, as a user of our Service. 

By accessing our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and [Terms of Use](https://gliu20.github.io/midway/terms), and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

## I. Information We Collect

We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email address, name, language preference, and profile picture, which you submit to us through the registration process through the Service.

### 1. Information collected via Technology

To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you may need to submit further Personal Information, which may include include name, email address, language preference, and profile picture. These data are collected and processed by Google’s Firebase to ensure the legitimacy of accounts and prevent the Service from fraud. By logging into the Service through your Google account, Google and Firebase may store this data in accordance with their own [Privacy Policy](https://accounts.google.com/TOS?loc=US&hl=en&privacy=true) and [Terms](https://accounts.google.com/TOS?loc=US&hl=en).

The Service may also use, collect, and store user-generated information to display to other users. These may include but are not limited to the following:
* Absent teacher data
* School information and activities
* School announcements
* Schedule information

### 2. Information you provide us by registering for an account

You can create an account on this Service by registering with the Service and entering your email address, and or by signing up for an account with Google’s OAuth authentication. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 3. Children’s Privacy

If you are under the age of 13, you may not create an account for the Service without the consent and approval from your legal parent or guardian, or from your school. In the event that we learn that we have gathered personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without the consent of a parent, guardian, or school, we will delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us. 

## II. How We Use And Share Information

*Personal Information:*

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. 

However, We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Developer, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy and their own.

In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us authenticate and verify you. For example, we use Personal Information to authenticate you and automatically load your school’s information where available.

We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law. 

*Non-Personal Information:*

In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Service. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners (e.g. Google’s Firebase) and other third parties at our discretion.


## III. How We Protect Information

We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by participating in Google’s Cross-Account Protection. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such mitigations. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.

## IV. Your Rights Regarding The Use Of Personal Information

You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes.  When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.

## V. Links To Other Websites And Services

As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Service. To the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application, then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of other websites before proceeding to use them.

## VI. Changes To Our Privacy Policy

The Developer reserves the right to change this policy and our Terms of Service at any time.  We will notify you of significant changes to our Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. Significant changes will go into effect 30 days following such notification. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately. You should periodically check the Site and this privacy page for updates.
