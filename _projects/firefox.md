I've always wanted to contribute to Firefox as it's an important part of my journey into learning about web development. Especially as someone who cares about the open web, I want Firefox to be part of the legacy for future web developers. In this series, I hope to discuss my journey into contributing to Firefox and the things that I learn along the way, and hopefully this would be helpful to those who want to go down the same path.

Happy hacking!!!
