# Purpose
School schedules are confusing, especially with multiple lunch times and different versions on different days. What if there was a way to help both students and staff navigate the new schedule?

## What is Midway?
Midway is an add-on that displays the end of the current period. In addition, it is now able to display absent teachers and school announcements.

## How do I get it?
Midway is available as a [Chrome extension in the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/midway/cgibedogghadelndgfacffoociffapii)
