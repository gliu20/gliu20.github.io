Algebraic fractals, like those of the Julia and the Mandelbrot Sets, are rich with interesting textures and designs. They are mathematical curiosities: out of such simple equations arises great complexity and beauty. 

## Demo
[Link to the demo.](https://gliu20.github.io/fractals/new.html) (Currently only zooming with mouse scroll works)

### Limitations
Due to the limitations of the precision of floating point arithmetic, if you see bars or a solid color, you may need to zoom out. 
 
### Controls
* Mouse
  * Scroll with your mouse in order to zoom in and out
  * Click and drag to pan around
* Touch
  * Use pinch gestures to zoom in and out
  * Touch and drag to pan around

### Coordinates of interest in the Mandelbrot set
