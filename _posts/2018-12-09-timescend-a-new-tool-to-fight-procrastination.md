# Why I made Timescend
To conclude the Transcendentalism unit, my English teacher allowed us to make a creative project that incorporated ideas of Transcendentalism. Being a programmer, I took this opportunity to make a useful application for increasing productivity.

# How Timescend Would Work
The program would essentially be a digital kitchen timer. It would ring every 45 minutes. After which, I would reflect on what I did. If I used my time well, I would relax for 15 minutes. If not, I would get back to work. Through this approach, I hoped to maximize my productivity.
