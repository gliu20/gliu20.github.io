# Productive sounds
As a productivity tool, Timescend lacked the ability to play soothing sounds. That's disappointing, considering the many studies that demonstrate the benefits of music on stress and productivity. Now, Timescend includes a loop player to help you increase your productivity. 

Just like [Noisli](https://www.noisli.com/), Timescend can now play calming sounds such as wildlife and rain.
